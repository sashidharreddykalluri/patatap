# patatap - This is a simple application that generates circles with different colors whenver a user clicks on the black screen. Along with the circles it'll produce various sounds as well.

1. As the browser doesn't allow cross origin requests, i've used a local server called 'Web server for chrome' to get the local server up and running.
2. This allowes the application to access the sound files sitting inside the 'sounds' folder.
